### Welcome to A Safe Safe
This was a hackathon project developed during HackRice 2016. It allows the user to lock and unlock a safe from his/her phone. It also allows the user to check if the safe is locked or unlocked as well as change the master password that secures the app. It also provides visual feedback (LED), audio feedback (buzzer), and physical feedback (servo moving a latch up and down to lock and unlock).

### Software and Hardware Requirements
* Raspberry Pi running TornadoWeb
* Arduino with the ability to connect to a computer with Arduino IDE
* Computer running PhoneGap software
* Smartphone running PhoneGap Developer App
